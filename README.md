# ipmi-check-temperature

Simple script that uses `ipmitool` to check room temperature (based on "Inlet Temp"); sends email notification if the temperature exceeds a maximum.

Important: there are many dedicated monitoring/reporting tools out there and this is not intended to replace them (obviously). 
This is just a simple backup script to act as a last resort warning if all else fails.
